      	   Hi, my name is Joni Lee. I am a rising junior at Lick-Wilmerding High School in San Francisco.
        At school, I am the fundraising coordinator for the Junior State of America club and am an avid attendee to ASIA club.
        I have been a Girl Scout for the past 11 years and am working towards earning my Gold Award.</p>  
      <br>I like to bake with or for my friends and family.
      Ultimately sharing the treats with people I care about put a smile on my face when my treats make them smile.
      <br>I dislike cloudy and rainy weather because I find myself feeling gloomy because of it during the winter months.
        <br>
      <br>Fun facts!
      <br>*My favorite tv shows include any murder-cop-mysteries, comedies, and cooking shows.
      <br>*I like to build Lego sets because I believe building/playing with Legos is an activity for all ages.
        <br>
